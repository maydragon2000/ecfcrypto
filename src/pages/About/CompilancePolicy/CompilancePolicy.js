                ECF undertakes due diligence of its customers prior to account opening and on an on-going basis throughout the business relationship. ECF may refuse to open an account or halt a customer’s continued access to the ECF platform if the customer does not meet our initial or ongoing KYC requirements.

            <p>
                Enhanced due diligence is conducted when a customer is deemed as exposing ECF to a high AML risk and/or when a transaction appears to be potentially suspicious on the basis of well-defined red flag indicators. Our client relationship staff will request additional KYC documents such as proof of source of the fund or additional identification documents as may be necessary to appropriately mitigate the risk. In such cases, an in-depth due diligence is conducted outlining the expected and actual transaction behavior and the on-going monitoring of transactions that may reveal potentially suspicious activities. Senior management approved is required prior to approving customers with high AML risk exposure.
            </p>

            <p>
                On an ongoing basis, our platform enables us to analyse the transaction behavior of the users while monitoring the volumes and frequency of their transactions.
                <br />
                In addition to the above, our tools enable us to identify the red flags based on different parameters we use for risk profiling of our customer base such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>	Occupation/pro¬fession</li>
                <li>	Expected transaction volumes and frequency</li>
                <li>	Age</li>
                <li>	Nationality</li>
                <li>	Location</li>
            </ul>
            <p>

Non-compliance to confidentiality provisions under any legislation and regulation to which ECF is subject may constitute a criminal offence against ECF, its directors, management, and its employees at fault.
            </p>
            <h2>Internal Audit’s Role</h2>
            <p>
