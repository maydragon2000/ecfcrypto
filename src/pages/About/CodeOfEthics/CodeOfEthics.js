            <h1>Code of Ethics </h1>
            <p>ECF, It’s a Brand name of Exim Credit Finance FZCO</p>
            <p>ECF thrives on the trust and confidence we enjoy from our employees, customers, and stakeholders. We gain credibility because we adhere to our commitments, displaying honesty and integrity and reaching company goals solely through honorable conduct. We do not merely say what we must do, our actions line up to what we say.</p>
            <p>When we consider any action, it is wise to ask: Will this build trust and credibility for ECF? Will it help create a working environment in which ECF can succeed over the long term? Is the commitment I am making one I can follow through with? The only way we will maximize trust and credibility is by answering “yes” to those questions and by working every day to build trust and credibility.</p>
            <h2>Respect for the Individual</h2>
            <p>We all deserve to work in an environment where we are treated with dignity and respect. ECF is committed to creating an environment where dignity and respect are upheld because it brings out the full potential in each of us, which, in turn, contributes directly to success as a business.
                <br />
                ECF is an equal opportunity employer; committed to providing a workplace that is free of discrimination of all types and from abusive, offensive, or harassing behaviour.
                <br />
                Any employee who feels harassed or discriminated against should report the incident to his or her manager or to human resources.
                <br />
                All ECF employees are expected to support an inclusive workplace by adhering to the following conduct standards:
            </p>
            <ul>
            	<li>Treat everyone with dignity and respect at all times.</li>
            	<li>Address and report inappropriate behaviour and comments that are discriminatory, harassing, abusive, offensive, or unwelcome.</li>
            	<li>Foster teamwork and employee participation, encouraging the representation of different employees’ perspectives.</li>
            	<li>Seek out insights from employees with different experiences, perspectives, and backgrounds.</li>
            	<li>Avoid slang or idioms that might not translate across cultures.</li>
            	<li>Support flexible work arrangements for co-workers with different needs, abilities and/or obligations.</li>
            	<li>Confront the decisions or behaviours of others that are based on conscious or unconscious biases.</li>
            	<li>ECF does not tolerate discrimination, harassment or any behaviour or language that is abusive, offensive, or unwelcome.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Create a Culture of Open and Honest Communication</h2>
            <p>
                Everyone at ECF is encouraged to feel comfortable to speak his or her mind, particularly with respect to ethics concerns.
                <br />
                Managers have a responsibility to create an open and supportive environment where employees feel comfortable raising such questions. We all benefit tremendously when employees exercise their power to prevent mistakes or wrongdoing by asking the right questions at the right times.
                <br />
                ECF will investigate all reported instances of questionable or unethical behaviour. In every instance where improper behaviour is found to have occurred, ECF will take appropriate action. We do not tolerate retaliation against employees who raise genuine ethics concerns in good faith.
                <br />
                Employees are encouraged, in the first instance, to address such issues with their managers or the VP of People, as most problems can be resolved swiftly. If for any reason that is not possible or if an employee is not comfortable raising the issue with his or her manager or the VP of People, employee can address the concern with the Chief Compliance Officer or according to the procedure defined in the whistleblowing policy.
            </p>
            <h2>Set Tone at the Top</h2>
            <p>
                ECF’ management team has the added responsibility for demonstrating, through their actions, the importance of this Code. Ethical behaviour does not simply happen in any business; it is the product of clear and direct communication of behavioural expectations, demonstrated from the top and by example. Ultimately, our actions are what matters.
                <br />
                To make our Code work, managers must be responsible for promptly addressing ethical question or concerns raised by employees and for taking the appropriate steps to deal with such issues. Managers should not consider employees’ ethics concerns as threats or challenges to their authority, but rather as another encouraged form of business communication. At ECF, we want the ethics dialogue to become a natural part of daily work.
            </p>
            <h2>Uphold the Law</h2>
            <p>
                ECF’s commitment to integrity begins with complying with the applicable laws, rules, and regulations everywhere we do business. Each employee must understand company policies, laws, rules, and regulations that apply to their specific roles. If we are unsure of whether a contemplated action is permitted by law or policy, we must seek further clarity and guidance from the Compliance team. We are responsible for preventing violations of law or breach of rules and regulations; and for speaking up if we see possible violations or breaches.
            </p>
            <h2>Competition</h2>
            <p>
                 We are dedicated to ethical, fair, and vigorous competition. We offer ECF products and services based on our merit, superior quality, functionality, and competitive pricing.
                We will make independent pricing and marketing decisions and will not improperly cooperate or coordinate our activities with our competitors.
                We will not offer or solicit improper payments or gratuities in connection with the purchase of goods or services for ECF or the sales of its products or services, nor will we engage or assist in unlawful boycotts of particular customers.
            </p>
            <h2>Avoid Conflicts of Interest</h2>
            <h3>Conflicts of Interest</h3>
            <p>
                ECF avoids any relationship or activity that might impair, or even appear to impair, our ability to make objective and fair decisions when performing our jobs. <br />
                At times, we may be faced with situations where the business actions we take may conflict with our own personal or family interests. We owe a duty to ECF to advance its legitimate interests when the opportunity to do so arises. We must never use ECF’ property or information for personal gain or personally take for ourselves any opportunity that is discovered through our position with ECF.
                <br />
                Here are some ways in which conflicts of interest could arise:
            </p>
            <ul>
            	<li>Being employed by, or acting as a consultant to, a competitor or potential competitor, supplier, or contractor, regardless of the nature of the employment, while you are employed with ECF.</li>
            	<li>Hiring or supervising family members or closely related persons.</li>
            	<li>Serving as a board member for an outside commercial company or organization.</li>
            	<li>Owning or having a substantial interest in a competitor, supplier, or contractor.</li>
            	<li>Having a personal interest, financial interest, or potential gain in any ECF transaction.</li>
            	<li>Placing company business with a firm owned or controlled by a ECF employee or his or her family.</li>
            	<li>Accepting gifts, discounts, favors or services from a customer/potential customer, competitor, or supplier, unless equally available to all ECF employees.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Determining whether a conflict of interest exists is not always easy to do. Any question on conflict of interest question should be directed to the Compliance team. Before engaging in any activity, transaction or relationship that might give rise to a conflict of interest, employees must seek consent from the Chief Compliance Officer.
            </p>
            <h3>Gifts, Gratuities and Business Courtesies</h3>
            <p>
                ECF is committed to competing solely on the merit of our products and services.
                <br />
                We should avoid any actions that create a perception that favorable treatment of outside entities by ECF was sought, received or given in exchange for personal business courtesies. Business courtesies include gifts, gratuities, meals, refreshments, entertainment or other benefits from persons or companies with whom ECF does or may do business.
                <br />
                We will neither give nor accept business courtesies that constitute, or could reasonably be perceived as constituting, unfair business inducements that would violate law, regulation or policies of ECF or customers, or would cause embarrassment or reflect negatively on ECF’s reputation.
            </p>
            <h3>Accepting Business Courtesies</h3>
            <p>
                Most business courtesies offered to us in the course of our employment are offered because of our positions at ECF. We should not feel any entitlement to accept and keep a business courtesy. Although we may not use our position at ECF to obtain business courtesies, and we must never ask for them, we may accept unsolicited business courtesies that promote successful working relationships and good will with the firms that ECF maintains or may establish a business relationship with. We must promptly notify the Chief Compliance Officer when we accept any business courtesies that promote/maintain successful working relationships and good will.
                <br />
                Employees who award contracts or who can influence the allocation of business, who create specifications that result in the placement of business or who participate in negotiation of contracts must be particularly careful to avoid actions that create the appearance of favoritism or that may adversely affect the company’s reputation for impartiality and fair dealing. The prudent course is to refuse a courtesy from a supplier when ECF is involved in choosing or reconfirming a supplier or under circumstances that would create an impression that offering courtesies is the way to obtain ECF’ business. 
            </p>
            <h3>Meals, Refreshments and Entertainment</h3>
            <p>
                We may accept occasional meals, refreshments, entertainment, and similar business courtesies that are shared with the person who has offered to pay for the meal or entertainment, provided that:   
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>	They are not inappropriately lavish or excessive.</li>
                <li>	The courtesies are not frequent and do not reflect a pattern of frequent acceptance of courtesies from the same person or entity.</li>
                <li>	The courtesy does not create the appearance of an attempt to influence business decisions, such as accepting courtesies or entertainment from a supplier whose contract is expiring in the near future.</li>
                <li>	The employee accepting the business courtesy has informed his or her manager or the Chief Compliance Officer of the business courtesy.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Gifts</h3>
            <p>
                Employees may accept unsolicited gifts, other than money, that conform to the reasonable ethical practices of the marketplace, including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>	Flowers, fruit baskets and other modest presents that commemorate a special occasion.</li>
                <li>	Gifts of nominal value, such as calendars, pens, mugs, caps, and t-shirts (or other novelty, advertising or promotional items).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Generally, employees may not accept compensation, honoraria, or money of any amount from entities with whom ECF does or may do business. Tangible gifts (including tickets to a sporting or entertainment event) that have a market value greater than $100 may not be accepted unless approval is obtained from the Chief Compliance Officer.
                <br />
                Employees with questions about accepting business courtesies should talk to their managers or the Chief Compliance Officer.
            </p>
            <h3>Offering Business Courtesies</h3>
            <p>
                Any employee who offers a business courtesy must assure that it cannot reasonably be interpreted as an attempt to gain an unfair business advantage or otherwise reflect negatively upon ECF. An employee may never use personal funds or resources to do something on a company level that cannot be done with ECF’ resources.
                Accounting for business courtesies must be done in accordance with approved procedures.
                <br />
                We may provide non monetary gifts (i.e., company logo apparel or similar promotional items) to our customers. Further, management may approve other courtesies, including meals, refreshments, or entertainment of reasonable value, provided that:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>	the practice does not violate any law or regulation or the standards of conduct of the recipient’s organization.</li>
                <li>	the business courtesy is consistent with industry practice, is infrequent in nature and is not lavish.</li>
                <li>	the business courtesy is properly reflected on the books and records of ECF.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Set Metrics and Report Results Accurately</h3>
            <p>
                Accurate Public Disclosures
                <br />
                We will make certain that all public disclosures and announcements made are full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable. This obligation applies to all employees with any responsibility for the preparation for disclosures and announcements, including drafting, reviewing, and signing or certifying the information contained therein. No business goal of any kind is ever an excuse for misrepresenting facts.
                <br />
                Employees should inform the Compliance team if they learn that information in any public communication was untrue or misleading at the time it was made or i subsequent information would affect a similar future public communication.
            </p>
            <h3>Corporate Recordkeeping</h3>
            <p>
                We create, retain, and dispose of our company records as part of our normal course of business in compliance with all ECF policies and procedures, as well as all applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
                <br />
                All corporate records must be true, accurate and complete, and company data must be promptly and accurately entered in our books in accordance with ECF’s and other applicable accounting principles.
                <br />
                We must not improperly influence, manipulate, or mislead any unauthorized audit, nor interfere with any auditor engaged to perform an internal independent audit of ECF books, records, processes or internal controls.
            </p>
            <h3>Promote Substance Over Form</h3>
            <p>
                At times, we are all faced with decisions we would rather not have to make and issues we would prefer to avoid. Sometimes, we hope that if we avoid confronting a problem, it will simply go away. At ECF, we must have the courage to tackle the tough decisions and make difficult choices, secured in the knowledge that ECF is committed to doing
                the right thing. At times, this will mean doing more than simply what the law requires. Merely because we can pursue a course of action does not mean we should do so.
                <br />
                Although ECF’s guiding principles cannot address every issue or provide answers to every problem, they can define the spirit in which we intend to do business and should guide us in our daily conduct.
            </p>
            <h3>Accountability</h3>
            <p>
                Each of us is responsible for knowing and adhering to the values and standards set in this Code and for asking questions if we are uncertain about company policy.
                If we are concerned whether the standards are being met or are aware of violations of the Code, we must contact the Compliance team.
                <br />
                ECF takes seriously the standards set forth in the Code, and violations are cause for disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.
            </p>
            <h3>Be Loyal</h3>
            <p>
                Confidential and Proprietary Information Integral to ECF’s business success is our protection of confidential company information, as well as non-public information entrusted to us by employees, customers, and other business partners. Confidential and proprietary information includes such things as pricing and financial data, customer names/addresses or non-public information about other companies, including current or potential supplier and vendors.
                <br />
                We will not disclose confidential and non-public information without a valid business purpose and proper authorization. In order to support the relevant authorities in detecting and preventing financial crimes such as money laundering and terrorist financing, ECF’ AML/CFT will maintain engagement with the Financial Intelligence Unit of the UAE Central Bank.
            </p>
            <h3>Use of Company Resources</h3>
            <p>
                Company resources, including time, material, equipment, and information, are provided for company business use. Nonetheless, occasional personal use is permissible as long as it does not affect job performance or cause a disruption to the workplace.
                <br />
                Employees and those who represent ECF are trusted to behave responsibly and use good judgment to conserve company resources. Managers are responsible for the resources assigned to their departments and are empowered to resolve issues concerning their proper use.
                <br />
                Generally, we will not use company equipment such as computers, copiers, and fax machines in the conduct of an outside business or in support of any religious, political or other outside daily activity, except for company-requested support. We will not solicit contributions nor distribute non-work related materials during work hours.
                <br />
                In order to protect the interests of the ECF network and our fellow employees, ECF reserves the right to monitor or review all data and information contained on an employee’s company-issued computer or electronic device, the use of the Internet or ECF’ intranet. We will not tolerate the use of company resources to create, access, store, print, solicit or send any materials that are harassing, threatening, abusive, or otherwise offensive or inappropriate.
                <br />
                Questions about the proper use of company resources should be directed to your manager.
            </p>
            <h3>Media Inquiries</h3>
            <p>From time to time, employees may be approached by reporters and other members of the media. In order to ensure that we speak with one voice and provide accurate information about the company, we should direct all media inquiries to the Director of Customer Services. No one may issue a press release without first consulting with the Chief Executive Officer.</p>
            <h3>Do the Right Thing</h3>
            <p>
                Several key questions can help identify situations that may be unethical, inappropriate, or illegal. Ask yourself:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>	Does my action comply with ECF’ guiding principles, Code of Conduct and company policies?</li>
                <li> 	Have I been asked to misrepresent information or deviate from normal procedure?</li>
                <li>	Would I feel comfortable describing my decision at a staff meeting?</li>
                <li>	How would it look if it made the headlines?</li>
                <li>	Am I being loyal to my family, my company and myself?</li>
                <li>	What would I tell my child to do?</li>
                <li>	Is this the right thing to do?</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
